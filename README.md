## React Native Utility Classes Example

This is an example Expo app containing code you might use to add a Bootstrap- / Tailwind-style utility class API to your app.

The app is very basic and just features a card example using my utility class API. You can use `yarn start` or `yarn ios` to lunch it in Expo.

There is a full blog post about this over on my website [here](https://michaelhueter.com/coding/blog/react-native-utility-classes).
